==Design Choices==

The problem is well known in cryptography as the generation of large prime numbers for RSA asymmetric encryption.
Truncatables are sub-set of prime numbers that can be computed via a recursive approach.

==Compilation==
The source code was developed with CodeBlocks on an Ubuntu machine with Boost libraries and OpenMP flags enabled.

==TO DO==
I didn't have time to implement a multi-thread implementation of the sieve block function.
